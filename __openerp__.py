		Remember, it is just a Bigger game:
			- DEV = 9x9
			- TEST = 13 x 13
			- PROD = 19 x 19


		Go - Fulcrum - TRAVIS Quality Controlled - 2019

		Learn from Go, to build and maintain territory:
			- Build Eyes. Which are the arrangement of internal liberties.
			- Not too few. Not too much. Two is the good number. 
			- Watch for the Atari, that comes from nowhere. 
			- Build ladders and recognize when your token are captured.

		New Micro Services:
			- Management Reports. Productivity. 
			- Appointments. 
			- New Products. 

		Critical Use Cases:

		  Dr has not created anything.


		Code without Tests is broken by design. Jacob Kaplan-Moss
		
		Zero Maintenance is Perfection. 

		My Goal is to achieve Complete Coverage. 

		Stability by Design. Simplicity by Abstraction. 

		La Estabilidad se consigue por la disminuci√≥n no por el aumento. 
		Dieter Rams: Less but Better. 

		More configuration and less programming, near than zero hacking.  

		Good order is the beginning of all good things.
